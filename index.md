## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a student-athlete at Cornell University with a strong interest in data science, cybersecurity, and thermodynamics. I am passionate about applying analytical and technical skills to real-world problems, whether through experimental engineering projects, building interactive simulations, or preparing for military and intelligence careers. Outside of academics, I am dedicated to athletics and personal discipline, using my experience in track and field and the military to mentor others in fitness, mental resilience, and personal growth. I enjoy combining hands-on experimentation, problem-solving, and leadership to create meaningful, impact-driven work.
